At 2:30 pm on November 23, 2024, the final of the 5th "Teochew Language Challenge" (來拼潮州話啦) hosted by Singapore Chui Huay Lim Club (醉花林俱樂部) and jointly organised by Singapore Teochew Heritage Society (潮州文史學會) was successfully held. After preliminary selection, a total of eight contestants were shortlisted for the finals, all of which were female.
</p>

<p>The finals are divided into five stages,</p>

<p><strong>1. True or false questions (是非題):</strong> five questions in total. A Chinese expression of a daily word and its Teochew characters will be displayed on the screen, and the contestants are required to tell whether the Teochew characters are written correctly.</p>

<p><strong>2. True or false & Correction (是非改正題):</strong> five questions in total. A Chinese expression of a daily word and its Teochew characters will be displayed on the screen.  Contestants are required to tell whether the Teochew characters are written correctly. If it is not correct, they need to write down the correct one.</p>

<p><strong>3. My mouth speaks and my hands speak (我口說我手):</strong> five questions in total. A Chinese word will be displayed on the screen, and the contestants are required to write down the corresponding Teochew characters and read them aloud.</p>

<p><strong>4. I know tongue twisters (我會繞口令):</strong> Each contestant will draw a Teochew tongue twister and read it aloud in Teochew.</p>

<p><strong>5. I'm good at Teochew (潮州話我叻):</strong> Four questions in total. A Chinese sentence will be displayed on the screen, and the contestants are required to translate the sentences into Teochew, write it in Teochw characters, and read it aloud.</p>

<p>Contestants scored points by answering questions, and the first, second, and third place were ultimately selected based on their scores.</p>

<p>Before the competition, Dr. Lim Yong Guan (林雍傑 博士), the first deputy prime minister of Chui Huay Lim Club and president of Singapore Theng Hai Huay Kuan (新加坡澄海會館), delivered a speech welcoming enthusiasts from all walks of life to attend. He said that Chui Huay Lim Club has always actively promoted Teochew culture activities, including organizing Teochew Good Voices (潮州好聲音), organizing Teochew opera troupes (潮劇團), and Teochew toastmasters (潮語講演會), etc. Teochew language does not only have sounds but characters. This competition is to promote the characters of Teochew language. This ancient culture deserves to be understood and learned by more people.</p>

<p>The competition is hosted by Mr. Lim Ngian Tiong (林仰忠 先生), a senior broadcaster in Singapore. He is also a teacher of the Teochew language class at the Singapore Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan (潮州八邑會館) and has taught for many years. Professor Lin Lunlun (林倫倫 教授), a contemporary Chinese linguist and phonologist, serves as the online judge. The global live broadcast was conducted by the non-profit organization "Escape Art Club (EAC, 跑路藝術小組)".</p>

<p>Professor Lin summarized the competition after it finished. He was deeply pleased with the efforts of the Teochew community in Singapore to protect and inherit the Teochew language, and deeply recognized the importance of Teochew language in cultural inheritance. He said that if Teochew language disappeared, there would be no Teochew operas, no Teochew nursery rhymes, and no Teochew culture. He encouraged everyone present to actively communicate with their relatives and friends in Teochew, teach children Teochew nursery rhymes, arouse their interest in Teochew dialect, and pass on this language. At the same time, he also mentioned that he has served as an online judge for the competition for 3 years. He feels that the difficulty of the competition questions is increasing year by year, and the performance of the contestants is beyond his expectation. He feels that some expressions are now difficult to hear in the Teochew, China.</p>

<p>The Singapore Teochew Heritage Society (潮州文史學會) was formed by a group of people in Singapore who are interested in Teochew culture. One of the members, Tan Gia Lim (陳嘉琳), said that the Teochew language used in daily conversations actually contains many Middle Chinese (中古漢語) words, and she hopes to deepen everyone's understanding of this aspect thrugh the competition. Escape Art Club (EAC, 跑路藝術小組) is a youth art group founded in Chaozhou, China, with the aim of "bringing the world into Chaozhou and Chaozhou going out to the world." Chua Peh Hng (蔡柏軒), one of the members, and me jointly broadcast the competition live globally through Zoom and Tencent meeting, attracting people from all over the world who are interested in Teochew culture to watch. On October 25, the EAC officially became a member of the HERITAGE Asia-Pacific (heritAP) network of UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Center, which aims to promote the protection of cultural heritage in the Asia-Pacific region through academic research, digital resources and cross-cultural exchanges. and promotion.</p>

<p>Some of the participants pointed out that the fourth stage of the competition, "I know tongue twisters", depends more on the contestants' luck. If they are lucky enough to draw a tongue twister that is easier to read, they can get a high score. This has nothing to do with the contestants' ability to understand Teochew, but only depends on luck which seems inappropriate. Some contestants also pointed out that the judge, Professor Lin Lunlun, is from Chenghai, China, and may not understand the differences between the local Teochew and the Teochew in China, so he gave low scores to the expressions that Singaporeans are accustomed to. In response to this, the host, Mr. Lim Ngian Tiong, responded that Professor Lin has a deep research on the Teochew in Southeast Asia and is quite tolerant and fair in giving points. It is inevitable that the Teochew in Singapore is deeply influenced by the Hokkien, and some expressions are "not that Teochew or Hokkien". This is a Teochew language competition, so of course "the more Teochew, the better."</p>

<p>All expenses for this competition are fully borne by the Chui Huay Lim Club Board of Directors. The Club was established in 1845 and is the oldest Teochew association in Singapore. In the early days, only powerful "Teochew Ah Ya (潮州阿爺)" were allowed to join. In recent years, the membership requirements have been relaxed and there are no longer restrictions on place of origin and income. However, the current members are still mainly Teochew.</p>
